# StackExchange data processing
Project created for *Processing of Structured Data* course, Data Science studies in the summer semester 2021/22 ðŸ’¡

## About project
The project task was to translate five `SQL` commands using `R` (base functions, `dplyr` and `data.table` packages) and `Python` (`NumPy` and `pandas`). The data used comes from the Travel Stack Exchange ðŸŒ´. The solution to each task includes a verbal interpretation of the command, code, comments, checking the equivalence of the solution to the SQL command, and comparing the execution time of the functions using the microbenchmark package (in R only).

I recommend reading summaries of the project (R and Python directories).
